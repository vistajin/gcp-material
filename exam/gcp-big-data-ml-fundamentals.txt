=====================================================
Cloud Pub/Sub - Decoupling producers and consumers of data in large organizations and complex systems
Cloud Dataflow - Scalable, fault-tolerant multi-step processing of data

=====================================================
Dataflow offers the following that makes it easy to create resilient streaming pipelines when working with unbounded data:(Select all 2 correct responses)
* Ability to flexibly reason about time
* Controls to ensure correctness
  Global message bus to buffer messages
  SQL support to query in-process results

B Pub/Sub	A. Controls to handle late-arriving and out-of-order data
A Dataflow	B. Global message queue
D BigQuery	C. Latency in the order of milliseconds when querying against overwhelming volume
C Bigtable	D. Query data as it arrives from streaming pipelines

=====================================================
The Dataflow models provides constructs that map to the four questions that are relevant in any out-of-order data processing pipeline:
Questions	Constructs
_B_ 1. What results are calculated?	A. Answered via Event-time windowing
_A_ 2. Where in event time are results calculated?	B. Answered via transformations
_D_ 3. When in processing time are results materialized?	C. Answered via Accumulation modes
_C_ 4. How do refinements of results relate?	D. Answered via Watermarks, triggers, and allowed lateness.

=====================================================
Which of the following is true for Data Studio ?
  Data Studio can only ingest files stored in Cloud Storage buckets.
? Data Studio supports data ingest thought multiple connectors.
  Data Studio is part of Dataflow and requires a streaming pipeline for data ingest.
  Data Studio is part of Google BigQuery and requires data to already exist in tables.
  
Data Studio can issue queries to BigQuery
* True
  False
